# Example how to ingtegrate static assets in Bokeh with Jinja2 Template Objects

    This example integrates a static asset,
    in this case a Matomo javascript snippet,
    in a Bokeh Webapp without the Directory-Style
    in case you have no influence over the
    startup command of Bokeh.
    This solution works therefore also with
    directly calling 'bokeh serve main.py'
